### Pilot Project  
An engineer and two high school students collaborated to assemble the **AR4 robot** in a MakerSpace.  
The robot was programmed to **automate lab-glass cleaning** at IFM, Linköping University.

### ⚙️ Strengths  
- Long reach  
- Accurate stepper motors  

### ⚠️ Weaknesses  
- No fast *drag-n-learn* feature  
- Slower than servo motors
