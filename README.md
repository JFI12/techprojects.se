Goal: Convince large companies to offer relevant projects to undergraduate engineers and ambitious high school studentsâ€”creating company value, improving education, and fostering a tech culture where people gather in MakerSpaces instead of bars.

AR4 value: The AR4 robot costs around 2200 USD and takes around 150 hours to assemble and 50 hours to trouble shoot. The final product corresponds to a commercial robot arm of around 4500 USD
